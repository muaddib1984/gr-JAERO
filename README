THIS IS HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL
Fixed Sample Rate 2.16Msps
It is assumed you are using a downshifted source for C-Band (like the Titanium C1WPLL)
The ZMQ input can be provided with a publisher from my STILLSUIT project
https://github.com/muaddib1984/STILLSUIT
run STILLSUIT for your radio of choice (USRP,RTL-SDR, etc)
./rtl_stillsuit.py -s 2.16e6 -f 1534e6 -g 1.0
you can adjust frequency and gain appropriately
Once running, stillsuit will publish the I/Q on port 5000

C-Band Hunter is comprised of standalone modular components as well as modular.
The aim was to provide a standalone app to confirm that the signals are being
seen properly and JAERO can decode the channels. The modular approach allows 
the user to tune in all 5 subbands visually and then close the GUI windows 
for headless operation. Currently the modular core app still has a small GUI 
window for the JAERO input Volume control that is non-functional at this time.

STANDALONE:
In the gr-JAERO/apps directory open the JAERO_ZMQ_CBAND_Hunter_core.grc in
GNURadio Companion, you can run it from there or generate the python code.
then run the JAERO_ZMQ_CBAND_HUNTER_GUI.grc flowgraph. That will allow you to
see the spectrum and different subbands, on the other tabs you will be able 
to see the single 10.5k channels from the channelizer.
run JAERO, open settings and set the zmq audio port to one of the 15 channels
in standalone these are 6001-6015

MODULAR:
open the flowgraphs in the cband_hunter_modular directory and generate the
python code
cd into the cband_hunter_modular directoy in a terminal adn run:
    python3 JAERO_ZMQ_CBAND_Hunter_core_subbands.py
    python3 JAERO_ZMQ_CBAND_Hunter_subband_channelizer.py -P 5001 -J 6001 -W 7001
    python3 ../JAERO_ZMQ_CBAND_Hunter_subband_channelizer_GUI.py -P 5001 -W 7001
    python3 JAERO_ZMQ_CBAND_Hunter_GUI.py
You should see spectrum in the main GUI and have the ability to adjust 
subband0. If you are seeing C-Band burst signals, adjust the position for 
subband0 and put the subband window (3 colored lines) around the carriers. 
Then line up the carriers in the subband channelizer channel slots 
(there are 15 small waterfalls, one for each 10.5k channel). Once you are
tuned in properly, you can run multiple jaero instances with the command:
jaero -s [name of instance]
the topic fields in the flowgraph are not fully worked out, 
they are 'oneone, twotwo, threethree,etc.' The topic fields aren't really
necessary here as each channel operates on one ZMQ Port, but they are still
required as JAERO needs to see the right topic. 

For operating all 5 subbands repeat the instructions above for the 
subband channelizer graphs:
For each subband, change the '-P 5001' to 5002,5003,5004 or 5005
These port numbers correspond to the 5 subband I/Q streams.
For each subband, run a subband channelizer (and GUI) but change the 
-W flag to be 7016,7032,7048,7064 and the -J flag to 6016,6032,6048,6064
These numbers are the port numbers for the internal routing of channelized
channel I/Q to waterfalls in the GUI flowgraphs (-W) and the individual
JAERO instances (-J), so JAERO will need to see the correct ports and topics.
As mentioned above, topics are stil not streamlined, so each channelizer
will have the same topics 'oneone,twotwo,...,fourteen,fifteen' even though 
the ZMQ Ports may be different. 

I will do my best to update this with better instructions at some point.
